# Octolight
This is a smart night light I have done for me kids.

It has two separate modules
a) under bed unit with RBG leds and motion sensor
b) bedside unit with led strip and push button to increase brightness

Basic functionality is that when ever motion is detected from under the bed (that would be me walking next to the bed)
the RGB leds are turned on with full white color. After motion is not detected, the RBG leds are smoothly dimmed to 
calm blue light that is not too bright for night. When button in bedside unit is pressed, it will turn on led strip in 
bedside unit and maximum white light from RBG leds under the bed.

It is called octolight, because my daughter is a big fan of the tv show and bedside unit has a picture of octonauts.
Octonauts picture is printed on a transparent and the led strip is placed behind this, so it will light up nicely
when the lights are on.

It seems it doesn't help my daughter to get any better sleep, but at least I don't have to stumble across dark room while
walking to her ;)
